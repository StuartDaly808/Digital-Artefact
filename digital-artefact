## Individual Analysis

### Research
I decided to choose this topic due to the worldwide effect technology has on our lives. I would like to disect the positive and negative impacts, that many people don't even realise. Apps like Facebook and Instagram can be useful more recieving news and communication, but can open up many dangers, by having personal information online. Good aspects of technology include access to information and easier communication, however, negative aspects include, distraction and relying too heavily on devices.

### Design
I have chosen to write this on a website, due to the fact that I find it easier to divide the impact of technology in everyday life into clear sections. A website was the best format to me because readers can read through at their own pace, allowing them to further understand the topic.

### Implementation
I made the website using Github, as it gave a clear tutorial of how to use it. I find my research to be successful, as this website helps give a clear insight into techonolgy. This webpage also works well on phones, tablets and computers. Each section has short and detailed paragraphs allowing me to get my point across off with ease and not having to waste time.

### My Role
As this was a solo webpage, I did everything myself, including writing, research and creating a webpage on Github. It allowed me to work on my organization within certain sections and share my work online. I also learned how to put myself into the shoes of the reader and include details that are only relevant.
