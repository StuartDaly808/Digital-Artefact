# Reflective Journal on Digital Humanities Topics

## Introduction
While being involved in this module, I have learned a lot of concepts that highlight how technology impacts society, cultures, and knowledge. Every week, I have gained new knowledge about how technology works, how it affects people for their benefit as well as harm, and how we should use it for good. In this assignment, I would like to reflect on what I learned in this module in terms of our readings, videos, and class sessions, as well as how it has impacted my perspective on technology.

## Week 1: Anatomy of an AI System, and a Brief History of the Web
In week one, we learned about AI systems and how they work. This has opened my eyes as I now realize that AI was never just a technology that “just figures things out.” Learning about AI systems and understanding how an AI system looks has taught me that AI is comprised of data, code, and human choice (Burrell, 2016). This has reminded me that AI systems are not completely objective. I now understand that it’s human choice, such as picking which data to use and how an algorithm should look, that impacts what the AI output will be.  

Week one has also opened my eyes to how the history of the Internet has been established. Learning about how ARPANET, Tim Berners-Lee, and Vint Cerf were able to create the web has taught me that it took a very long period of time for the web to be developed (Castells, 2001). I was surprised to learn that it was a cable in Ireland, known as the Valentia transatlantic cable, that gave “access to the worldwide Internet.” This has taught me that it’s not all about technology, but also about people.

## Week 2 & 3 – Transformations, HTML, and Open Access
Weeks 2 and 3 focused on how information moves from paper to screen, and we started to learn coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Seeing how a simple webpage came together showed that a webpage was not only for showing information but also a concept of structure and design (Mozilla Foundation, 2023). This assignment enabled me to see how information can be structured and how small changes in coding can make a huge impact on how it can be used by those wishing to access it.

During this time, we were also introduced to Open Access, and we watched “The Internet’s Own Boy,” a documentary on Aaron Swartz, a true hero who stood for open access to all knowledge. I started to think about how knowledge itself has paywalls around it that limit who can acquire it. The readings and Guerilla Open Access Manifesto gave me plenty to think about when it came to fairness and moral implications of access to knowledge (Eve, 2014). I also started to think about how I, as a tech user, needed to use technology morally for my own knowledge acquisition. I also learned further about web design when I was assembling all of my projects and started to think about how they needed to be accessible to as many different types of users as possible.

## Week 4 – Digital Integrity, Social Media, and Surveillance
Week four has been about digital integrity and responsibility. Reading “A Contract for the Web” by Tim Berners-Lee in 2019 and “books related to the Filter Bubble” by Eli Pariser in 2011 has opened my eyes to how our worldview is being shaped by social media sites and search engines. I also learned that many of our sources are shaped by algorithms that are beyond our control.

We also read “books related to Surveillance Capitalism” by Shoshana Zuboff in 2019, which explained how our data creates sources of income for search engines and companies. Looking back on how I use technology, I can now see that every like, comment, and click changes our worldview from search engines and social media sites. A TED Talk video by Carole Cadwalladr reinforced in class how important it is to think twice before putting any information online. I learned this week that to be a good citizen of this world of technology, it is important to be a critical thinker. I also started offering ways I personally will change how I use technology in my life.

## Week 5 – Project Workshop: Digital Education and Wellbeing
The fifth week consisted of a practical task related to digital education and wellbeing. Here, we critically analyzed a preprint article related to “design thinking for digital wellbeing” by van der Velden and Robinson in 2021. This experience has opened my eyes to how important design is. Websites that are user-friendly are stress-reducing and contribute to effective learning. Another important point is that when there is too much screen use, a lack of wellbeing follows; therefore, a design point related to balance would be pertinent.

I now realize that digital literacy encompasses more than technical skills. Digital literacy encompasses an understanding of how technology impacts individuals’ feelings and wellbeing. I learned from class experience that design thinking has immense value in group work. This experience from Week Five has enabled me to develop a hands-on understanding of how design, ethics, and theories are interconnected in practical projects related to technologies.
